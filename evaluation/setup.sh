# One-time setup to run the exo Harbor benchmark on a fresh machine.
#
#   ./setup.sh
#
# Installs the harbor CLI, builds the slim exo bundle, and installs the Python
# deps used by the report scripts. Re-running is safe (idempotent-ish).
#
# This folder lives inside the exo repo; the bundle is built from that repo
# (one level up). Prereqs you must provide yourself:
#   - The exo repo at a base including PR #68 (this is it — one level up).
#   - Rust + the x86_64-unknown-linux-musl target, musl-tools, and pnpm
#     (needed by build-bundle.sh to produce a portable static exo binary).
#   - uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for the harbor CLI.
#   - Docker (the default Harbor environment runs each task in a container).
#   - OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment when you run ./run.sh.
