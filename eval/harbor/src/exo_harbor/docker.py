"""Host-side resolution of the Docker container Harbor started for a trial.

Harbor's DockerEnvironment brings the task up with Docker Compose under a
project name derived from the public ``environment.session_id``, with the task
container as the ``main`` service. We find it by label from the host.

Deliberately not done via ``BaseEnvironment.exec()``: that runs *inside* the
task container, where recovering the host-side container identity is
unreliable. This is host work and belongs in the external agent.
