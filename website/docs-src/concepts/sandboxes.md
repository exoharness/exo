# Sandboxes

Agents benefit from being able to write and run commands in secure
environments. The exoharness runs sandboxes with pluggable backends and
gives agents lifecycle control — `create`, `start`, `stop`, `snapshot` —
plus arbitrary command execution inside them.

## Backends

| Backend | Type | Notes |
|:--------|:-----|:------|
| `docker` | Local | Container; the default |
| `apple-container` | Local | Container (macOS) |
| `local-process` | Local | No isolation — commands run on the host |
| `daytona` | Remote | [daytona.io](https://www.daytona.io) |
| `e2b` | Remote | [e2b.dev](https://e2b.dev) |
| `sprites` | Remote | [sprites.dev](https://sprites.dev) |
| `vercel` | Remote | [Vercel Sandbox](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-sandbox) |
| `aws-agentcore` | Remote | [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) |

Select a provider with `sandbox.provider` in the agent spec; local providers
need no credentials. Specs use underscores for multiword names, such as
`apple_container` and `local_process`:

```bash
exo agent create 'My Agent' --file agent.md
```

**Remote** backends are configured as bindings and need an API key:

```bash
exo vault secret create global <name> --token-env <PROVIDER_API_KEY>
exo environment provider create --backend <name> --secret <name>
```

Remote backends run the sandbox on hosted infrastructure instead of your
machine, so it keeps running even when your local process stops.

## Scope

A sandbox can be scoped to a **conversation** (each conversation gets its
own) or to an **agent** (shared across the agent's conversations) — set at
creation with `conversation create --sandbox-scope <agent|conversation>`.
Long-running personal agents like the canonical exo agent typically use an
agent-scoped sandbox so installed tools persist across conversations.

## Lifecycle

Sandboxes move through create → start/run → snapshot/stop, or through
**attach / detach** when Exo borrows an externally created environment
(for example a Docker container started by another system). Attached
sandboxes must be detached, not stopped. For the full state machine,
candidate selection during a turn, and how agent vs conversation scope
behaves over time, see [Lifecycles → Sandbox](./lifecycles#sandbox-lifecycle).

## Snapshots

Snapshotting a sandbox writes a snapshot id to the event log, tying
filesystem state to conversation history. That's what lets
[time travel](./time-travel) restore not just what was said, but the
environment the agent was working in.

## Secrets in sandboxes

Secrets can be securely mounted into sandboxes so programs inside can use
them **without the LLM being able to view or expose them** — see
[Bindings & Secrets](./bindings-and-secrets).
